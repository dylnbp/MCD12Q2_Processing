# remotely-sensed-spring-phenology
The global land surface phenology (MCD12Q2 V6 product) was downloaded from NASA's Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC), and processed to evaluate spring phenology trends in central asia and south asia.

The onset of greenness layer involved in the MCD12Q2 V6 HDF4 file provides metrics of spring phenology (indicated by day of year) at a spatial resolution of 500m.
