# remotely-sensed-spring-phenology
The global land surface phenology (MCD12Q2 V6 product) was downloaded from NASA's Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC), and processed to evaluate trends in spring phenology in central asia and south asia.

The onset of greenness layer involved in the MCD12Q2 V6 HDF4 file provides spring phenological metrics, indicated by day of year (DOY), at a spatial resolution of 500m.
