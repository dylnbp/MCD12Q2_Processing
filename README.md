# remotely-sensed-spring-phenology
The global land surface phenology (MCD12Q2 V6 product, 500m resolution) was downloaded from NASA's Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC), and processed to evaluate vegetation spring phenology trends in central asia and south asia.

The onset of greeness layer involved in the MCD12Q2 V6 HDF4 file provides spring ph, and used to the pixel values were transformed into the day of year (DOY) which represents the timing of spring onset.
